# URL Shortener Microservice

This project is a URL Shortener Microservice that allows users to shorten a long URL into a short, numeric-based URL, which can be used to quickly redirect back to the original URL. The microservice is built using Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

## Project Overview

The URL Shortener Microservice provides an API where users can submit a long URL, and in return, they receive a short URL that is associated with it. Users can then use the short URL to be redirected to the original website. The service also ensures that only valid URLs are shortened.

## Technologies Used

HTML5: Provides the structure of the webpage.
CSS3: Styles for layout and presentation.
JavaScript (Node.js with Express): Handles the server logic and API functionality.
MongoDB (Mongoose): For storing URLs and the associated shortened URLs.
Valid-url: For URL validation before shortening.
